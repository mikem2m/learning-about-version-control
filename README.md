# learning-about-version-control
Author: Michael Suriawan

Solving merge conflicts takes conscious effort, but I can do it!

What I like about version control: Makes working in a collaborative setting much easier!

What I find challenging: Dealing with rebases / branching / merging when the repository gets too big (too many collaborators).
